# About Me

Zhen Zhang （张珍）I am a graduate student in the [Internet of Everything Group](https://ioe.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Ozgur Akan](https://ioe.eng.cam.ac.uk/directory/akan), and funded by the Cambridge Trust and CSC Scholarships. I also had the pleasure of participating in a summer research program with [Prof. Pietro Liò](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) at the [Artificial Intelligence Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/ai/).

Prior to Cambridge, I have worked on wireless networks and cybersecurity under the guidance of [Prof. Zhezhuang Xu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=iZ7LQRkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Dr. Meng Yuan](https://myuan27.github.io/). Besides, I was honored to be selected as an Undergraduate Scholar at the leading conferences AAAI 2024 and SIGKDD 2024.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and academic collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at — **hc663 [at] cam.ac.uk**
